# Sudoku
A Sudoku game is a logic-based number-placement puzzle. The game consists of a 9x9 grid, divided into 3x3 sub-grids, where players fill in the empty cells with numbers from 1 to 9. The goal is to fill in the grid in such a way that every row, every column and every sub-grid contains all the numbers from 1 to 9.
